# Helium
Helium is a calculator writen in C# that allows you to evaluate advanced math expression, including logarithms, exponents, trigonometric functions while keeping the order of operations.
# Examples
Here are example expressions.
```
2 + 2 * 2
(2 + 2) * 2
x^2

```
#### Factorial
You can also use factorial notation.
```
n!
```
#### Logarithms
If the base is not specified it assumes 10. For common logarithms you can use ```ln x``` for natural log and ```lg x``` for log base 10.
```
log_y x
log_y(x)
```
#### Trigonometry
```
sin x
cos y
tan z
```
Note that to use inverse trigonometric functions, you **cannot** use notation ```sin^-1 x```, insted use ```arcsin x```
